# Fizzbuzz - Elixir

## The Problem

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## The Solution 

Assuming you installed [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and have `mix` in your `PATH`:

``` console
$ git clone git@github.com:bchase/fizzbuzz-elixir.git
$ cd fizzbuzz-elixir
$ mix run 
```
